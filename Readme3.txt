TEAM CONTRIBUTIONS
•	ASHWINI: Has helped with the coding and implementation of files
•	BHUVANA: Has tried different ways to implement program efficiently and checked for errors.
•	KRUTHIKA: Has helped in decoding the logic part and debug the errors.

INSTRUCTIONS
Make sure that the program and the input file are in same folder
When you run the program mention the input file name and the starting vertex as the arguments without fail.

CHALLENGES FACED
1) One of the main challenge that we faced is related to the files. Reading and storing the data from file was not like how we do usually. The first number stored in file is n, next one is m . Storing the contents of next n and m lines was a challenge. So we had to store the entire contents of file into an array and then extract the needed information from them.
2) After getting the logic we were not getting proper output...so we had to do reverse engineering to find out where the problem was .We found out that the vertex weights were not getting stored, so we had to make some changes in the for loop to overcome that.
THE IMPORTANT LINKS THAT WE USED ARE

As we had learnt Dijkstra algorithm in DAA LAB program we had some idea of what we were dealing with.

 LEARNT FROM ASSIGNMENT
In conclusion, we learnt how to implement and perform operations on a file and this assignment made us to think logically and improve our skills in doing so.
